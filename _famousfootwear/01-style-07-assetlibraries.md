#Adobe CC Asset Library
The Adobe CC Library contains the assets needed to quickly create your marketing messaging (i.e. emails, banners, ads, etc.). To receive access to this library, email the username of your Adobe CC account to [Joe Ebeler](mailto:jebeler@caleres.com?Subject=Asset Library Access Request).

**NOTE: You must have an Adobe CC account to be able to use the asset library**

1. To use the Asset Libraries, choose one of the three libraries *Famous Styles, Famous Assets, Famous UI* from the dropdown option in the *Libraries* window.
